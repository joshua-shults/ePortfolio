        <h2>Professional Summary</h2>
        <p>
            I am a Computer Science student with a strong focus on software testing,
            quality assurance, and secure development practices. My coursework and
            projects emphasize writing testable code, identifying defects, improving
            reliability, and evaluating software systems from both technical and
            user-focused perspectives.

    <h1>Professional Self-Assessment</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
    My name is Joshua Shults, and I am about to complete my bachelor’s degree in
    Computer Science. This assessment was written for my Computer Science Capstone
    course and is included as part of my GitHub ePortfolio. Throughout my pursuit
    of this degree, I have developed a wide range of skills, including coding,
    software lifecycle maintenance, quality assurance, data analytics, security,
    and communication with team members and stakeholders.
</p>

<h2>Self-Evaluation of Skills</h2>
<p>
    For an honest self-evaluation, I believe that quality assurance and data analytics
    are my strongest skill areas. My weakest area among these skills is coding,
    although I recognize that programming is a lifelong discipline that requires
    continual practice and experience to master. While coding is not currently my
    strongest skill, I am confident in my programming abilities and continue to
    improve through hands-on project work.
</p>

<h2>Quality Assurance Experience</h2>
<p>
    In reference to my quality assurance skills, I point to the two programs included
    in the <em>Enhanced Programs</em> branch of this ePortfolio. In the appointment
    application, I implemented JUnit tests for all classes from the original program.
    These tests were designed to ensure that objects behave exactly as intended.
</p>
<p>
    Quality assurance is not only the area where I feel most comfortable, but also
    where I find the most enjoyment. I enjoy debugging issues, whether in my own code
    or in provided code, and this is where I believe I perform strongest. I am very
    detail-oriented, and I believe this makes me well-suited for a career in quality
    assurance, whether designing test cases or executing them.
</p>

<h2>Data Analytics and Communication</h2>
<p>
    My skills in data analytics and communication are demonstrated through my DAT-300
    project, which is included in the <em>Additional Resources</em> branch of my
    ePortfolio. In this project, I used Power BI to analyze a dataset and draw
    meaningful conclusions.
</p>
<p>
    For the written portion of the project, I communicated my findings to a
    non-technical audience, which I feel I did particularly well. I enjoy uncovering
    answers to questions, and this aligns closely with the role of a data analyst,
    whose responsibility is to derive business insights from data.
</p>

<h2>Program Outcomes and Artifacts</h2>
<p>
    Throughout my coursework, I have gained experience in communication skills,
    data structures and algorithms, software engineering, databases, and security.
    I believe the artifacts and enhanced programs included in this ePortfolio
    effectively showcase these skills.
</p>
<p>
    In the appointment application, I demonstrate software development skills, and
    through enhancements that upload user input into a SQL database, I further show
    my understanding of data structures and databases. In the weight tracker
    application, I continue to showcase my skills in software engineering,
    databases, data structures, and security.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
    These artifacts represent only the beginning of my professional ePortfolio.
    I plan to continue expanding and refining this collection as I grow within
    the field of computer science and further develop my professional skill set.
</p>
