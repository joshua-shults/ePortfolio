Included in this branch are my artifact programs used in my capstone course. These
are the original projects I made for previous courses, including a simple weight
tracking mobile application and an appointment application. The appointment application
was made solely for the purpose of JUNIT testing and does not contain a main program.

Also included is the plan I made in the first week of the capstone course for the
enhancements that are in the 3rd branch of this github.
